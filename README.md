Work Division
======================
1. PCA. Objective is to write a function which will take the number of dimensions 
   (number of principal components) as input, so that we can try how many 
   principal components (after PCA) give best results                       : Shruthi and Kirti
2. Bayesian classifier (Implement and application)                          : Sachin
3. Histogram classifier (Implement and application)                         : Aidyn
3. Linear classifier - Multiclass with Kesler's construction
                        (Implement and application)                         : Shahnam
4. Create confusion matrices for bayesian and histogram classifiers         : Supriya
5. Read data (X and T) from data files and final integration of the peices  : Sandesh


Expectations
=======
1. Write the generic code
2. No hardcoded values in the code/functions
3. Unit test your code
